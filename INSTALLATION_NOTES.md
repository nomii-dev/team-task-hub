## 📝 Note About Drag-and-Drop

The initial `package.json` included `react-beautiful-dnd` for potential drag-and-drop functionality. However, this library is not yet compatible with React 19.

**What was changed:**
- Removed `react-beautiful-dnd` dependency
- Removed `@types/react-beautiful-dnd` dev dependency

**Impact:**
- None! The current implementation doesn't use drag-and-drop
- Tasks can still be moved between columns using the edit dialog and context menu
- All features work perfectly without this library

## 🔮 Future Drag-and-Drop Implementation

If you want to add drag-and-drop functionality in the future, you have several options:

### Option 1: Wait for React 19 Support
Wait for `react-beautiful-dnd` to support React 19, or use a fork that does.

### Option 2: Use Alternative Libraries

**@dnd-kit/core** (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable
```
- Modern, React 19 compatible
- Better performance
- Active maintenance
- [Documentation](https://docs.dndkit.com/)

**react-dnd**
```bash
npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
```
- Well-established library
- React 19 compatible
- More complex API

**Pragmatic drag and drop** (by Atlassian)
```bash
npm install @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop
```
- Framework agnostic
- High performance
- Modern approach

### Option 3: Downgrade React (Not Recommended)
```bash
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
```
This would allow `react-beautiful-dnd` to work, but you'd lose React 19 features.

## 🎯 Current Task Movement

The app currently supports moving tasks via:

1. **Edit Dialog**: Click a task → Change status dropdown → Save
2. **Context Menu**: Click ⋮ on task → "Move to [column]"
3. **API**: Direct API calls to update task status

This provides full functionality without drag-and-drop!

## 🚀 Next Steps

Your installation is complete! You can now:

1. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. **Start development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
